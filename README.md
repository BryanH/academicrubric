# Academic Rubric

This app is designed to help an academic program candidate determine their likelihood of being accepted to a restricted program.


## Requirements

To **build** and **test** the code, you will need

* NPM (included with [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/)) and
* [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com) - note you need the command-line version

**The first time** you will need to install the project dependencies.

1. Switch to the project directory
2. run `npm install` (*not with sudo*)

To serve the code, you do not need anything except a working webserver.

## Build & development

Run `grunt` for building and `grunt serve` for preview.

## Testing

Running `grunt test` will run the unit tests with karma.
